# Week 1.3, Session 2: Word Counter

# We want to read in a text file, and calculate how many words are in it. 
# You can use any of the .txt files to test this - or even make your own.

# open and read the file

with open ("story2.txt", "r") as File:
    text = File.read()


# calculate the number of words
# hint: you could use .split() to break up by spaces
# hint: watch out for empty lines that might give you empty strings

words = text.split() 
word_count = len(words)



# display the wordcount

print("Word count is: ", word_count)

# Here are the word counts you should get:
# story.txt - 290
# story2.txt - 326
# glasses.txt - 210
